# Lines starting with pound are comments and blank lines are ignored.

# Synonym relationships can be defined as unidirectional or bidirectional relationships.

# Unidirection relationships are represented by any term sequence 
# on the left hand side (LHS) of "=>" followed by synonyms on the right hand side (RHS)
CodeStar => AWS CodeStar
S3 => Amazon S3
#s3, S3, Amazon s3 => Amazon S3
# This will map CodeStar to AWS CodeStar, but not vice-versa

# Multiple synonym relationships may be defined in one line as well by comma seperation.
autoscaling group, ASG => Auto Scaling group, autoscaling


# The above is equivalent to:
# autoscaling group => Auto Scaling group, autoscaling
# ASG => Auto Scaling group, autoscaling

# Bi-directional synonyms are comma separated terms with no "=>"
DNS, Route53, Route 53
# S3, Amazon S3
# DNS, Route53, and Route 53 map to one another and are interchangeable at match time
# The above is equivalent to:
# DNS => Route53, Route 53
# Route53 => DNS, Route 53
# Route 53 => DNS, Route53

# Overlapping LHS terms will be merged
Beta => Alpha
Beta => Gamma
Beta, Delta
# is equivalent to:
# Beta => Alpha, Gamma, Delta
# Delta => Beta

# Synonym rule count is the total number of lines defining synonym relationships
# Term count is the total number of unique terms for all rules. 
# This thesaurus has a synonym rule count of 6 and a term count of 18. 
# Comments and blanks lines do not count.
